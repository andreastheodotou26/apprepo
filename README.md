Read me file for apprepo
=======

This is the app that i have created so far. My coding skills are not the best as it is not my strong hand. 

Anyway the app logic goes like this:

This app will be given to all the ambasadors of a company and will contain all their products. 

The app structure is:

Category -> Brands -> Products

Products details will be filled within an exel file and then will be converted to xml format. (this data is stored on the libs
folder)

The products have a material number (which is unique), a description, the category, brandname and image pathname.

Specs:

1) When new products occure sync when connect with wifi.
2) Categories with brand lists will be stable and when new brands or categories occur update them manually.
3) We will use dropbox to store the images.

Notes: For each product page i have created a different script that will automatically laod all the product images.

I am using Phonegap to convert the app to apk.
